It involves the use of mathematical techniques to summarize, visualize, and draw conclusions from data. The main goal of statistics is to extract meaningful information from data, make predictions, and support decision-making in various fields such as business, healthcare, social sciences, and many more.\n",

The standard deviation of 16 in this case indicates how far scores are distributed above or below the mean score of 100. A higher standard deviation means that scores are more spread out, while a lower standard deviation means that scores are closer to the mean.\n",

      "In statistics, we use measures such as the mean and standard deviation to understand the distribution of data. For example, in a normal distribution, two standard deviations above and below the mean include about 95% of all samples. This means that most of the data points are within two standard deviations of the mean, which is a useful range for making predictions and drawing conclusions.\n",
